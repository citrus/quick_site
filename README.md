Quick Site
==========

** ---- Work in progress! ---- **

Quick Site is a light-weight Sinatra app designed to make creating & deploying static websites a breeze. Quick Site was inspired by [StaticMatic](https://github.com/staticmatic/staticmatic), [Nesta](http://effectif.com/nesta) and mostly just the idea of being able to use modern tools like HAML & Less to create simple static sites.

To use quick site:

    git://github.com/citrus/quick_site.git
    cd quick_site
    bundle install
    
Edit `config/development.yml` to your liking.
    
Boot with your server of choice:
    
    thin start -p 4567
    # or
    unicorn -p 4567
    # or just
    ruby app.rb
    

Open [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) in your favorite browser and enter the name of your new site. After it's created, navigate to http://localhost:4567/sites/your_site/**your/new/page** to automatically create additional pages. Edit your pages to your liking using haml. <3



**Currently in progress:** Once you're happy with your site, visit http://localhost:4567/**sites/your_site/_deploy** to upload your changes to your server. 



If you'd like to restart the app on each request: (for development)
    
    shotgun -p 4567 $PWD/app.rb
    
For some reason the public folder can't be swapped when using shotgun... 


Documentation
-------------

RDoc's can be generated by running the `rake rdoc` command:

    git clone git://github.com/citrus/quick_site.git
    cd quick_site
    rake rdoc

Now open `rdoc/index.html` in your browser...


Testing
-------

Shouda tests can be run with:

    git clone git://github.com/citrus/quick_site.git
    cd quick_site
    rake



To Do
-----

* Refactor deploy code..
* Improve styles and views
* Add more fields to new site form (email?/server config?)
* Add image_tag helper
* Add Less/SCSS support
* Switch to a more clever name?


Notes
-----

Quick Site was built on a Mac with Ruby 1.9 in mind. 1.8.x compatibility has not been tested.
